Hive- LLM ( P2P Communication with Kademlia )
This repository contains a Python script that enables peer-to-peer communication between multiple instances of a language model (LLM) using the Kademlia distributed hash table. The script utilizes asyncio and SSL to establish secure communication channels and exchange JSON-encoded messages between the nodes.

This is a work in progress, currently its a ideea that im trying to apply to any communication agents, mainly Auto-GPT , with further implementation to any other Automated agents.
